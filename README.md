# Program Brief

The ReadyCodePush program charter and overview.

## What

Participants in the program will experience unmediated hands-on building, collaborating, deploying, and securing software built on top of open-source development methodologies.

## Goal

Educate, accelerate and inspire technical expertise in open-source software development models.

## Why

We firmly believe that advances in digital transformation and technology are rooted in the foundations of the opensource movement, the unprecedented rise of opensource software, and the significant impact opensource software ecosystems are making on everyday life on earth and beyond.

That said, many developers lack experience and skills in open-source software development models and collaboration. We also recognize that software is eating the world and technology is ought to be accessible to everyone and made available to diversified and inclusive groups in particular.

With that in mind, we have set on a path to build this program to educate, accelerate and inspire individuals to participate in open-source software development communities.

## Audience

We have identified the following groups as those who are likely to be with the most relevant and benefit of gaining experience in open-source development models:

* Computer Science students & High-schoolers
* Software developers who are inexperienced with open-source software and GitHub

It is to be noted, that this program seeks to maximize the potential reach to underrepresented groups and values diversity and inclusivity above all.

## What you will learn

* Fundamentals of open-source software
* Practical development workflows of open-source software ontop of the GitHub developer platform, including repository management, forking, issues and pull requests.
* Basic principles of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and source code versioning with Git
* Proficiency in Markdown markup language
* GitHub.dev Cloud IDE
* Basic principles of DevOps, and deploying software with GitHub Actions
* Introduction to open-source software supply chain security, the impact of open-source security, and shipping secure software

## How

The program spans a total of 4 to 6 classes of 2 and a half hours, meeting at a cadence of weekly or forth-nightly, in which students are actively participating via hands-on instructor-led workshop sessions using their laptops, or computer equipment that will be provided for the class.

## KPI

Short-term success metrics, < 6 months:

* Executing a total of two programs
* Gender diversity of >= 30% women students
* Students attrition rate through-out program attendance to completion <= 15%

Long-term success metrics, > 6 months of the program run time:

* This program team constitutes 3 active program managers
* This program inspires and coaches a student to join the GitHub Campus Experts program

## Background

This program was as an initiative to promote awareness and participation in open-source software development, by Liran Tal on 2022.

* GitHub Action and English spelling/grammar as part of a CI for the GitHub User profile of previous workshop session
* Network with your classmate, learn something about them that they haven’t added to their GitHub profile, and raise a pull request to reflect it

## Chapter 4: Securing open-source software

Topics:

* Open-source software supply chain security and the security of open-source software packages.
* Licensing, governance models, security hygiene
* Demonstrating an interactive live hack for a security vulnerability manifesting in an open source package

Exercise:

* Fork the [demo vulnerable application](https://github.com/snyk-labs/nodejs-goof)
* Connect to Snyk with your GitHub account, and import the demoo application
* Brief overview of a vulnerability, and automatically fixing them with Pull Requests using Snyk

## Chapter 4: Conclusion

This is also the last chapter and meeting that will be the graduation class.
Where do we go from here? Maintaining a presence in open-source communities enables networking, opens opportunities for growth, empowers learning, sets you up for success with work interviews. Become a GitHub Campus Expert and help support the developer community around you. Survey form. Open panel discussion (career, tech, community, etc).
